ABOUT ME
========
![Elżbieta Adamska](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4226/34841541561_27718c9afe_z.jpg)

Hello there! My name is Elizabeth (feel free to call me Ella) and I’m a passionate wedding, family and event photographer with a strong street, travel & documentary background and over 10 years of experience - first as a hobby then as a source of income.
 
Why would you choose me as your photographer? 
Because years of experience have taught me how to be at the exact time in the exact place to capture the exact moment. 
My photography is less about posing. It's all about emotions. 

In front of my camera, you never feel uptight. Our photoshoot is going to be easy as pie. It’s my job to make you look like a professional model, not yours. Your job is to be yourself. 

I completed dozens of photoshoots and brought heaps of happy tears to my customers. 
Please, have a look at my wedding, family, event, travel or reportage portfolio and decide how you want to create your memories: the conventional way or my way - natural, emotional and candid.
