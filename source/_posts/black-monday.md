On 3rd of October 2016 women across Poland went on strike against the total abortion ban which had been introduced to the Polish parliament. 

On that day women refused to carry out their professional duties and household chores.
Instead they went out of the street wearing black a sign of mourning for their freedom of choice. 

These photographs were taken in Pozna≈Ñ, western Poland, but similar scenes happened on that day across the whole country. Despite the heavy rain, nearly 10 000 people gathered to protest in the centre of the city and the vast sea of black umbrellas became the symbol of Black Monday.
