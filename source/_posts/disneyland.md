Where Donald Duck meets Japanese mindset there surely will be a lot of fun. Strictly controlled, safety-regulated kind of fun. 

In Japan order is a must, even in Disneyland. 

Abandon hope all ye who enter here because the first thing that greets you after you enter the gate is a member of Disneyland staff holding a sign saying: FOR SAFETY PLEASE WALK. Any disobedience will be (very politely yet very openly) frowned upon. 

Welcome to the kingdom of your kindergarten dreams. Just try not to enjoy it too much.
