Forget about Rio De Janeiro carnival. 

If you want to experience some decent carnival fun not as a distant viewer with a camera equipped with a telephoto lens in one hand and binoculars in the other, head to Bolivia. 
If you want to feel what’s it like to be a part of all day lasting party on equal rights with the locals, go to the town of Potosi. 

But beware: equal rights mean equal obligations. 
Tourist or no tourist, with a camera or without one, you will be covered with foam (espuma) from head to toes. 
Be prepared to duck and cover.
Don’t be afraid to fight back - it’s where the real fun starts.
