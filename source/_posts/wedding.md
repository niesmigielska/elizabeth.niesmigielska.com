Let me accompany you on your wedding day and together weâ€™ll tell an unforgettable story. 
Wedding photography I take resembles reportage more than anything else. 
A glance that no one else notices, a child minding his own business under the table and letting grown-ups do their adulty stuff. A happy tear here and there. My job is to seize all the details that make your wedding day special. 

My presence as your photographer truly is stress-free. I always encourage you to act at ease and just be yourselves. 

Works 10 times out of 10.
