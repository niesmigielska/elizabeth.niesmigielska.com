Let me accompany you on your wedding day and together weâ€™ll tell an unforgettable story. 
Wedding photography I make resemble reportage more than anything else. 
A glance that no one else notices, the children minding their own businesses and letting grown-ups do their adulty stuff, a happy tear here and there. 

My presence as your photographer truly is stress-free. I always encourage you to act at ease and just be yourselves. 

Works 10 times out of 10.
