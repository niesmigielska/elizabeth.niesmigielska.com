Woodstock Festival Poland (currently known as Pol'and'Rock Festival but let’s face it - nobody uses new name) is an annual free rock music festival in Poland, inspired by Woodstock Festival. Dubbed to be "the biggest open-air festival in Europe".

That’s what you can read in Wikipedia. But it’s so much more than that. Woodstock Festival is a symbol and an institution led by a living legend, Jurek Owsiak - an incredible man behind the biggest charity event in Poland: a  Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity. For over 20 years, Woodstock Festival has been a way of saying thank you to those who made it possible. 

All for free and all about freedom. 

23rd edition of Woodstock Festival was held in July 2016 in Kostrzyn nad Odra, Poland.
