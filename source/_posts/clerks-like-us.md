In Poland, a visit to any kind of office is comparable to a visit to a dentist. 
You push it away until it can’t be ignored any longer. Once you set out, you have to be prepared both mentally (clerks in Poland are believed to be the most obnoxious people on earth) and physically (long lines and seating scarcity). Every Polish child knows that clerks’ only reason of existence is to make a decent citizen’s life harder. 

I tried to break up that stereotype but after 7 years of being underpaid, underappreciated and overlooked, I resigned. 

These photographs are not instagram-worthy. These photographs depict the everyday life of an average worker in the Registry Office, who - believe it or not - is on the same side of the barricade as his clients. 

They were exhibited in PIX.HOUSE Gallery, Poznan in September 2017.
